# DoseScope
> Track and monitor substances in the bloodstream.

**DoseScope** is a tracking application designed to monitor the presence of various substances, such as drugs, foods, and supplementsâ€”in the bloodstream. It provides users with interactive tools to manage intake schedules, visualize metabolization rates, and analyze health data over time. Built with Electron, React, and D3.js, DoseScope offers a robust and responsive experience.

## Installing / Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
2. **npm** (v6 or higher)
3. **Electron** (v13 or higher)

### Steps to Set Up

To get DoseScope up and running locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hillmatt7/DoseScope.git
cd DoseScope

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode, and the Electron window should open automatically.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Graphing**: Track and analyze substance levels over time using a responsive graphing interface powered by D3.js.
  - Pan and zoom like a graphing calculator or TradingView.
  - Hover over data points to view detailed tooltips.
- **Customizable Protocols**:
  - Create, edit, and manage intake schedules for substances.
  - Define dosage, offset, frequency, and duration with intuitive controls.
  - Include multiple substances in one protocol and compare them visually.
- **Real-Time Visualization**:
  - View and analyze metabolization rates with dynamic chart updates.
  - Overlay multiple substances to explore interactions and effects.
- **Drag-and-Drop Sidebar**:
  - A resizable and draggable sidebar for managing protocols and compounds.
- **User-Friendly Modals**:
  - Add or edit protocols and substances with streamlined modal interfaces.

### Additional Features
- **Zoom and Pan**: Navigate through detailed data using zoom and pan features.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts seamlessly across screen sizes.
- **Protocol Export**: Save protocols as JSON files for easy sharing or backup.

## File Structure

### Key Files and Directories
- **`src/`**: Contains all source code for the application.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable React components (e.g., `Graph.js`, `Sidebar.js`).
  - **`styles.css`**: Contains all styling for the application.
  - **`App.js`**: Main React application logic.
- **`main.js`**: Electron main process for handling windows and IPC communication.
- **`preload.js`**: Exposes secure APIs for communication between Electron and React.
- **`webpack.config.js`**: Configures Webpack for bundling the application.
- **`dist/`**: Compiled assets for the Electron app.
- **`package.json`**: Manages dependencies and scripts for the project.

### Graphing Features
The graph is implemented using D3.js and provides:
- **Zooming and Panning**: Users can zoom in/out and pan across the chart.
- **Gridlines**: Helps users understand the context of data points.
- **Dynamic Axes**: Automatically update during zoom or pan interactions.
- **Tooltips**: Display detailed information on hover.

## Developing

To contribute to or modify DoseScope, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hillmatt7/DoseScope.git
cd DoseScope

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

This setup runs the app in development mode with hot-reloading.

### Building the Application

To create a production build of DoseScope, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready version of the app in the `dist/` folder.

### Running Electron in Production Mode

```bash
npm start
```

This command launches the Electron application using the production build.

## Known Issues

- **Performance**: For large datasets, the graph may experience some lag during zooming and panning. Optimization efforts are ongoing.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure all inputs (e.g., dosage, frequency) are properly validated to prevent crashes.
