# DoseScope
> Track and monitor substances in the bloodstream with precision.

**DoseScope** is a tracking application designed to monitor the presence of various substances—such as drugs, foods, and supplements—in the bloodstream. It helps users manage intake schedules, visualize metabolization rates, and track health metrics over time.

## Installing / Getting Started

To get DoseScope up and running, follow these quick steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hillmatt7/DoseScope.git
cd DoseScope
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Running the code above will start the application locally at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Initial Configuration

Some configuration may be required based on specific project needs:
- **API Keys**: Add any API keys needed in `config.py` or set them as environment variables.
- **Database Setup**: If a database is used, follow configuration steps found in `config.py` to ensure it connects correctly.

## Developing

To develop DoseScope further, follow these steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hillmatt7/DoseScope.git
cd DoseScope/
python3 -m venv venv      # Set up virtual environment (optional)
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This setup will prepare your environment for development with all necessary dependencies.

### Building

If any additional build steps are required (e.g., for production deployment), outline them here. Example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

This would configure, build, and install any required packages or dependencies for production.

## Features

DoseScope includes several powerful features:
* **Real-Time Bloodstream Tracking**: Visualize how various substances metabolize in real-time.
* **Customizable Protocols**: Define intake schedules and protocols for different substances.
* **Timeline Navigation**: Easily track and view intake, peaks, and metabolization stages over time.
* **Multi-Substance Analysis**: Overlay multiple substances to analyze interactions and manage health metrics.
